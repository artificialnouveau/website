# Hi there

I'm Ahnjili (aka Artificial Nouveau) and welcome to my personal page. You can also check out my instagram page at @artificialnouveau. 

## Upcoming Talks & Workshops (Bio is down below)

### POV Drone Workshop

Drones are capable of highly advanced surveillance and can come equipped with live-feed video cameras paired with face, object, and body recognition. This allows for the automated tracking of individuals. Surveillance drones can and have raised significant privacy and civil liberties issues. To highlight current and potential issues relating to the hyper-personalization surveillance of individuals, I will be giving a workshop on how to build and deploy their own smart drone.

- Location: L.A.
- Date: TBD

### AI Pickup Artist Workshop

Machines are not immune from bias because bias exists in the humans that design them. We can, however, make those biases more obvious, expose them, and try to overcome them as we find them. ﻿For this workshop, we will create an AI pickup artist, an interactive web app that detects and classifies who you find attractive or not. The AI pickup artist is an art project that examines every step of the AI process including data collection, data labeling, data training, selecting an algorithm to use, the algorithmic model, and then the design of the AI pickup artist. What data would you feed your AI pickup artist? What would an acceptable error rate be? How would you deploy it? Would your potential suitors be receptive to it? The AI pickup artist will allow users to reflect on the role of humans in designing AI algorithms.

Participants will learn about the essential steps for building a facial recognition algorithm (using python):

    Data Collection & Labelling

    Data Preprocessing

    Training a facial recognition algorithm

    Prototyping the algorithm in the wild
    
- Location: iii, Den Haag, The Netherlands 

- Dates:TBD


### How To Analyze Your Google Search History

Why should Google (and its ad babies) be the only ones to learn about who you are via your search history? This workshop will give participants the guides and tools to take a peek into the hidden patterns of our own google search history.

Participants will learn how to use python to perform data mining and information retrieval tasks using your Google Search History

- Location: InScience Film Festival
- Dates: November 2021 - Cancelled due to covid, may be rescheduled


### Build your own ‘Doe Normaal’ Algorithm

The Dutch phrase ‘doe normaal,’ that directly translates into “be normal,” or “act normal.” It’s a phrase that can be used as a reaction to a wide range of strangebehaviors from others. It can be used for anything from a minor infraction of an unwritten social rule to the kind of truly crazy behavior that might get you committed. Because of this it might not always be easy to understand exactly why someone started shouting ‘doe normaal’ at you.

In 2017, Mark Rutte, the Dutch Prime Minister said 'Doe normaal of ga weg' (Act normal or go away) and ‘Normaal doen is de norm die we moeten uitdragen.’ (Acting normally is the norm we have to promote). His examples of ‘Doe normaal’ included 'you should shake women's hands and not throw trash on the street'. In this workshop we will explore the subjectivity and possible sinister undertones of a 'Doe Normaal' surveillance system.

Location and Dates: TBD

Past Talks & Workshops

### Impakt Festival: Makers Meet & Eat

Tijdens de Meet & Eat schuif je bij uiteenlopende makers aan tafel om kennis te maken met hun werkwijze en onderzoek op het gebied van digitale kunst, cultuur en design. Een middag voor ontmoeting, kennisdelen, tricks of the trade en een kijkje in de keuken. Het programma sluit af met een barbecue gehost door Venster, waarbij onder genot van een goede hap, een biertje en (hopelijk) de zon wordt nagepraat.

I will be discussing my Mozilla Fellowship Project. 

- Location: Raum, Utrecht, Netherlands
- Dates: September 19th 2021



## Official Short Bio

Ahnjili is a New York-born, Hong Kong-raised, Netherlands-based data scientist, Ph.D. candidate, artist, and science communicator. Ahnjili's academic research focuses on developing smartphones- and wearables-based biomarkers that can be used to monitor one’s mental and physical wellbeing for clinical trials. Ahnjili's artistic research and science communication focuses on educating the public about A.I. and algorithmic violence, which refers to the violence that is justified or is created by an automated decision-making system. The themes addressed in her work include predictive policing and DIY biased surveillance. Ahnjili is a Mozilla Creative Media and Erasmus+ Grant Awardee.

## Academic Background

Growing up, I was fascinated by synthetic biology and decided to pursue a BSc in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Edinburgh. 

Due to my interest in psychedelic research, I completed my Cognitive Neuroscience MSc at Radboud University, where I did my thesis on the effects of mindfulness, Ritalin and LSD on cognitive flexibility. 

Swept up by the AI hype storm, I decided to pursue a PhD in digital phenotyping. Prior to this, for a year I worked as a data science consultant for a digital marketing company. Completely bored by converting clicks into cash, I decided to focus on more meaningful datasets. Now I focus on how our interaction with our digital tools can be a reflection of our mental and physical well-being. Along this path, I also hope to address how gender, race, social class, age, physical disability, and sexual orientation affect the automated classification of human beings into categories of psychiatric diagnosis.

## Confessions

I am a complete scanner (in case you haven’t noticed already). I’m interested in so many things that I find it difficult to devote myself to one hobby or interest. I am quick to embrace everything that excites and inspires me — so I tend to ditch those interests when something more interesting comes along. 

Over the years, these are the few interests that have stayed constant: 

    Falling into internet wormholes

    Film Theory

    Keeping up to date with Data related dramas

My fascinations of 2022:

    Health Surveillance

    Surveillance

    Algorithmic violence
